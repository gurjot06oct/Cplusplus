#include <iostream>

// Wrap around or Circular behavior in data types, like signed integers, refers to values looping within their range. When a value exceeds its maximum, it wraps to the minimum, and vice versa, creating a closed loop of possible values. This behavior arises due to two's complement representation, where incrementing past the maximum results in the minimum value, and decrementing below the minimum results in the maximum value. Thus, values are circularly connected, forming a continuous loop within the range of the data type.

int main()
{
    int maxValue = 2147483647;  // Maximum value of int
    int minValue = -2147483648; // Minimum value of int

    // Incrementing maxValue by 1
    maxValue++;
    std::cout << "After incrementing maxValue: " << maxValue << std::endl;

    // Decrementing minValue by 1
    minValue--;
    std::cout << "After decrementing minValue: " << minValue << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

// ### Explanation:

// - `maxValue` is initialized with `2147483647`, which is the maximum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
// - When `maxValue` is incremented by 1, it wraps around to `-2147483648`, the minimum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
// - Similarly, `minValue` is initialized with `-2147483648`, the minimum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
// - When `minValue` is decremented by 1, it wraps around to `2147483647`, the maximum value representable by a 32-bit signed integer.
