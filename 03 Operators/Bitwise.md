### Binary Representation and Bitwise Operations in C++

Binary representation and bitwise operations are fundamental concepts in computer programming, especially when dealing with low-level operations and hardware interactions.

#### Binary Representation of Negative Numbers

In computer systems, negative numbers are typically represented using the two's complement notation. Let's explore how `-1` is represented in binary:

- **In 4-bit representation:**
  - Binary representation of `1`: `0001`
  - To find `-1`:
    1. Invert all bits of `1` (one's complement): `1110`
    2. Add `1` to the result: `1110 + 1 = 1111`
  - Therefore, in 4 bits, `-1` is represented as `1111`.
- **In 32-bit integer representation:**
  - Binary representation of `1`: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001`
  - Binary representation of `-1`: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111`

#### Bitwise Operations

##### Bitwise AND (`&`) with `0xF`

Let's apply the bitwise AND operation to `negativeOne` (`num1`) with `0xF` (which is `0000 1111` in binary):

```cpp
int negativeOne = -1;
int lowerFourBits = negativeOne & 0xF; // lowerFourBits = 15 (00001111)
```

Here, `lowerFourBits` results in `15`, preserving the lower 4 bits of `negativeOne`.

##### Bitwise NOT (`~`) and Interpretation

Using bitwise NOT (`~`) on a negative number illustrates its effect in two's complement representation:

```cpp
int negativeFifteen = -15; // Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001 (two's complement)
int complementOfNegativeFifteen = ~negativeFifteen; // complementOfNegativeFifteen = 14 (00000000 00000000 00000000 00001110)
```

Here, `complementOfNegativeFifteen` complements all bits of `negativeFifteen`, resulting in `14`.

#### Bitwise Operators

##### Bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`)

These operators manipulate individual bits of integers:

```cpp
int numberA = 5; // Binary: 0101
int numberB = 3; // Binary: 0011

int resultAND = numberA & numberB; // resultAND = 1 (0001)
int resultOR = numberA | numberB;  // resultOR = 7 (0111)
int resultXOR = numberA ^ numberB; // resultXOR = 6 (0110)
```

These operations demonstrate logical AND, OR, and XOR operations on corresponding bits.

##### Left Shift (`<<`) and Right Shift (`>>`)

Bitwise left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) move bits left or right:

```cpp
int numberC = 5; // Binary: 0101
int resultLeftShift = numberC << 3; // resultLeftShift = 40 (101000)

int numberD = 40; // Binary: 101000
int resultRightShift = numberD >> 3; // resultRightShift = 5 (000101)
```

These operations multiply or divide by powers of two, respectively.

##### Handling Negative Numbers with Shifts

Shifting negative numbers demonstrates how two's complement handles sign extension:

```cpp
int negativeFifteenShifted = -15; // Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001 (two's complement)
int resultLeftShiftNegative = negativeFifteenShifted << 3; // resultLeftShiftNegative = -120 (10001000)

int negativeOneTwenty = -120; // Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 10001000 (two's complement)
int resultRightShiftNegative = negativeOneTwenty >> 3; // resultRightShiftNegative = -15 (11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001)
```

These examples highlight how shifts affect negative integers, preserving their sign.

Understanding binary representation and bitwise operations in C++ is crucial for efficient manipulation of data at the bit level. These operations are foundational in low-level programming, offering precise control over individual bits within variables. By mastering these concepts, programmers can optimize algorithms and handle hardware interactions effectively.
