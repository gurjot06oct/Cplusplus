## Comments in C++

This code demonstrates the usage of single-line and multi-line comments in C++. Comments are useful for explaining code and making it more readable.

### Single-Line Comment

```cpp
// This is a single-line comment
```

Single-line comments begin with `//` and extend to the end of the line. They are used for brief explanations or annotations within the code.

### Multi-Line Comment

```cpp
/*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
*/
```

Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. They are used for longer explanations that span multiple lines.
