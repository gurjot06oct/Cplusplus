## Dimensional Pointers in C++

Understanding dimensional pointers in C++ involves grasping pointers that point to array of different dimensions. Let's explore the types of dimensional pointers and how they are utilized in practice:

### Types:

- **0D Pointer**: Points to individual elements.
- **1D Pointer**: Points to rows or single arrays.
- **2D Pointer**: Points to the entire 2D array.
  In C++, dimensional pointers refer to pointers that point to arrays of different dimensions. This concept is often used when dealing with arrays, matrices, and multi-dimensional data structures. Let's delve into each type of dimensional pointer and how they are utilized, particularly focusing on dynamic allocation of memory.

### Types of Dimensional Pointers

#### 0D Pointer (T\*)

A 0D pointer, or a pointer to an individual element, is straightforward. It points directly to a single element of type T.

```cpp
T* ptr = new T;
```

- **Returns**: A pointer (`T*`) to the single allocated memory of type `T`.

```cpp
T* ptr = new T[row_size];
```

- **Returns**: A pointer (`T*`) to the first element of the allocated memory of type `T`.

#### 1D Pointer (T (\*)[n])

A 1D pointer in this context points to a row or a single array in memory. This is commonly used when dealing with dynamically allocated arrays.

```cpp
T (*ptr)[size] = new T[row_size][size];
```

- **Returns**: Points to an entire row or single array within a larger multi-dimensional structure.

#### 2D Pointer (T (\*)[n][m])

A 2D pointer points to the entire 2D array. It is often used to manage and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.

```cpp
T (**ptr)[row_size][col_size] = new T[row_size][col_size];
```

- **Returns**: Manages a complete 2D array, allowing operations on rows and columns.
