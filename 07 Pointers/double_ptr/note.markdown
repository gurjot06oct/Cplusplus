A double pointer in C++ is a pointer that points to another pointer. It is also known as a pointer to pointer. Double pointers are used to store the address of another pointer, allowing indirect access to a variable or memory location. Understanding double pointers is crucial for tasks like dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of arrays of pointers.

### Declaration Syntax:

The syntax for declaring a double pointer involves specifying two levels of indirection:

```cpp
type** ptr;
```

### Common Use Cases:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Double pointers are commonly used in dynamic memory allocation to manage memory blocks.
2. **Function Arguments**: Double pointers are used to modify pointer values in functions and return multiple values.
3. **Arrays of Pointers**: Double pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of pointers dynamically.
4. **Linked Lists**: Double pointers are used in linked list implementations to traverse and manipulate nodes.

### Pointer to Pointer to Pointer (Triple Pointer):

It's also possible to have a pointer to a pointer to a pointer, known as a triple pointer. The concept extends recursively to higher levels of indirection.
