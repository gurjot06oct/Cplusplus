Certainly! Let's go through the dynamic allocation of a 3D array in direct order, first allocating the single pointer, then double pointer, and finally the triple pointer. Hereâ€™s how you can manage memory allocation for a 3D array in this order in C++:

### Steps for Dynamic Allocation:

1. **Single Pointer Allocation**: Allocate memory for the `type T`.
2. **Double Pointer Allocation**: Allocate memory for the pointer to `type T`.
3. **Triple Pointer Allocation**: Allocate memory for the pointer to pointer to `type T`.

### **Single Pointer**:

- `T * ptr = new T(value);` dynamically allocates memory for an integer and initializes it to `value`.
- Allocates memory for an `T` and initializes it to value

### **Double Pointer**:

- **Declaration then Initialization**:

  ```cpp
  T **ptr2ptr = new T*;
  *ptr2ptr =  ptr;
  ```

  - Allocates memory for a pointer to an `T`.
  - Sets the value of the pointer to point to ptr.

- **Declaration with Initialization**:
  ```cpp
  T **ptr2ptr = new T*(ptr);
  ```
  - Allocates memory for a pointer to an `T` and initializes it to point to ptr

### **Triple Pointer**:

- **Declaration then Initialization**:

  ```cpp
  T ***ptr2ptr2ptr = new T**;
  *ptr2ptr2ptr = ptr2ptr;
  ```

  - Allocates memory for a pointer to a pointer to an `T`
  - Sets the value of the pointer to point to ptr2ptr

- **Declaration with Initialization**:

  ```cpp
  T ***ptr2ptr2ptr = new T**(ptr2ptr);
  ```

  - Allocates memory for a pointer to a pointer to an integer and initializes it to point to ptr2ptr

4. **Memory Deallocation**:
   ```cpp
   delete ptr;
   delete ptr2ptr;
   delete ptr2ptr2ptr;
   ```
   - Each dynamically allocated memory block is freed in the reverse order of allocation to avoid memory leaks.
