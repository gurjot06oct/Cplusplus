### Recursion in C++

Recursion is a powerful technique in programming where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's particularly useful for problems that exhibit a hierarchical structure or can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type.

#### Basic Structure of Recursive Functions

A recursive function typically consists of two main parts:

1. **Base Case**: This is the terminating condition that stops the recursion. Without a base case, the function would infinitely call itself, leading to a stack overflow.
2. **Recursive Case**: This is where the function calls itself with modified arguments, progressing towards the base case.

#### Example: Computing Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer $ n $, denoted as $ n! $, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $ n $.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to compute factorial recursively
int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    // Recursive case
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is: " << factorial(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Indirect Recursion

Indirect recursion occurs when one function calls another function, which in turn calls the first function, creating a loop of function calls.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void function2(int n); // Forward declaration

void function1(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << n << " ";
        function2(n - 1); // Call to function2
    }
}

void function2(int n) {
    if (n > 1) {
        cout << n << " ";
        function1(n / 2); // Call to function1
    }
}

int main() {
    function1(5); // Outputs: 5 4 2 1
    return 0;
}
```

#### Memoization

Memoization is a technique to optimize recursive algorithms by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

unordered_map<int, int> memo;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    }
    if (memo.find(n) != memo.end()) {
        return memo[n];
    }
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    return memo[n];
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Fibonacci of " << n << " is: " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

#### Tail Recursion Optimization

Tail recursion optimization is a compiler optimization technique where recursive calls in tail position (last operation before returning) are optimized into iterative form to save stack space.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to compute factorial using tail recursion (not optimized here)
int factorial(int n, int result = 1) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return result;
    }
    return factorial(n - 1, result * n);
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Factorial of " << n << " is: " << factorial(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Recursion provides an elegant solution to certain types of problems in programming, offering clarity and conciseness in code. Understanding its basic structure, handling of base and recursive cases, as well as optimization techniques like memoization and tail recursion, is crucial for mastering recursion in C++. These techniques not only enhance program efficiency but also demonstrate the versatility of recursive thinking in problem-solving.
