### Static Data Members

Static data members in C++ are class members declared using the `static` keyword. They possess special characteristics, as outlined below:

- Only one copy of the member is created for the entire class and is shared among all objects of that class, regardless of the number of objects created.
- They are initialized before any object of the class is created, even before the `main` function starts.
- They are visible only within the class, but their lifetime spans the entire program execution.

#### Syntax

```cpp
static data_type static_data_member_name;
```

#### Example Program:

Let's explore a C++ program demonstrating the usage of static data members:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
public:
    Counter() {
        cout << "Counter's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

class Record {
    static Counter counter;

public:
    Record() {
        cout << "Record's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Record record;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Record's Constructor Called
```

Explanation: The program calls only Record's constructor, not Counter's constructor. This is because static members are declared but not defined within the class declaration. They must be explicitly defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator.

#### Accessing Static Members

Static members can only be declared within the class declaration. Attempting to access a static data member without explicit definition will result in a compilation error. Let's examine the following program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    int value;

public:
    Counter() {
        cout << "Counter's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

class Record {
    static Counter counter;

public:
    Record() {
        cout << "Record's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
    static Counter getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }
};

int main() {
    Record record;
    Counter counter = record.getCounter();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Compiler Error: undefined reference to `Record::counter'
```

Explanation: In this example, static member ‘counter’ is accessed without explicit definition, leading to a compilation error. To resolve this error, we need to define the static member 'counter' globally.

#### Defining Static Data Members

To access static data members of any class, they must be defined first. Here's an example program demonstrating this concept:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    int value;

public:
    Counter() {
        cout << "Counter's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

class Record {
    static Counter counter;

public:
    Record() {
        cout << "Record's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
    static Counter getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }
};

// Definition of static member 'counter'
Counter Record::counter;

int main() {
    Record record1, record2, record3;
    Counter counter = Record::getCounter();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Counter's Constructor Called
Record's Constructor Called
Record's Constructor Called
Record's Constructor Called
```

Explanation: The program calls Record's constructor three times for three objects (`record1`, `record2`, and `record3`), but Counter's constructor is called only once. This demonstrates that static members are shared among all objects of the class.

#### Accessing Static Members Without Objects

Static members can be accessed without any object by using the scope resolution operator directly with the class name. Let's see an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    int value;

public:
    Counter() {
        cout << "Counter's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
};

class Record {
    static Counter counter;

public:
    Record() {
        cout << "Record's Constructor Called" << endl;
    }
    static Counter getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }
};

// Definition of static member 'counter'
Counter Record::counter;

int main() {
    // Static member 'counter' is accessed without any object of Record
    Counter counter = Record::getCounter();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Counter's Constructor Called
```

#### Static Data Members in Local Classes

In C++, static data members cannot be declared in local classes.
