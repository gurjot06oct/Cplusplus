### Standard Exception Hierarchy, Exception Specifications, and Modern Exception Handling

In C++, exceptions are organized into a standard hierarchy to facilitate structured error handling. The base class for all standard exceptions is `std::exception`, which provides a `what()` method to retrieve an error message associated with the exception. Derived classes like `std::runtime_error` and `std::logic_error` categorize exceptions based on their nature, such as runtime errors and logic errors respectively.

Prior to C++11, exception specifications were used to declare which exceptions functions could throw. This feature allowed functions to specify whether they threw no exceptions (`throw()`), any exception (`throw(...)`), or specific exceptions (`throw(Type1, Type2)`). However, this approach was found to be limiting and was deprecated in favor of modern exception handling.

C++11 introduced improvements in exception handling with the `noexcept` specifier. Functions marked with `noexcept` indicate that they do not throw exceptions, improving efficiency by allowing certain optimizations by the compiler and indicating stronger exception safety guarantees.

```cpp
#include <stdexcept>

void someFunction() noexcept {
    // Function marked as noexcept
    // ...
}

void riskyFunction() {
    if (/* error condition */) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Error message");
    }
}

int main() {
    try {
        someFunction();
        riskyFunction();
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
        // Handle runtime_error exception
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        // Handle other standard exceptions
    } catch (...) {
        // Catch-all for any other exceptions
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Modern C++ encourages the use of `noexcept` where appropriate to enhance code clarity and performance. Additionally, it emphasizes leveraging the standard exception hierarchy (`std::exception` and its subclasses) for consistent and well-understood exception handling practices. These advancements contribute to writing more robust and maintainable codebases with effective error management strategies.
