### Multidimensional Arrays in C++

In programming, multidimensional arrays are essential for handling structured data, such as matrices, where data is organized into rows and columns. Let's delve into how multidimensional arrays are declared, initialized, and utilized in C++ with a practical example.

#### Declaration and Initialization

```cpp
const int rows = 3;
const int cols = 3;

int matrix[rows][cols] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

In C++, a multidimensional array is declared with syntax specifying its dimensions (`rows` and `cols` in this case). The matrix `matrix` is initialized using nested curly braces `{}` to define each row's elements sequentially. This initialization ensures that the matrix is filled row by row with the specified values `{1, 2, 3}`, `{4, 5, 6}`, `{7, 8, 9}`.

#### Accessing and Printing Elements

```cpp
std::cout << "Matrix:" << std::endl;
for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i)
{
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; ++j)
    {
        std::cout << matrix[i][j] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
```

To print the matrix, nested `for` loops iterate through each element. The outer loop controls the rows (`i` represents the row index), while the inner loop controls the columns (`j` represents the column index). Inside the loops, `matrix[i][j]` accesses and outputs each element of the matrix in a row-major order, ensuring that each row is printed sequentially.

#### Output

The output generated by the above code snippet is:

```
Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

This output visually represents the matrix initialized earlier. Each row is printed on a separate line, maintaining the structure defined during initialization.
