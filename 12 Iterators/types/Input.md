# Input Iterators

## Overview

Input iterators are considered the simplest and weakest among all iterator categories based on their functionality. They are used primarily for sequential input operations, where each value is read only once, and the iterator is incremented to move to the next element. Despite their limitations, input iterators are fundamental and underpin more powerful iterator types like forward, bidirectional, and random-access iterators.

## Salient Features

1. **Usability**:

   - Input iterators are suitable for single-pass algorithms, which means they can traverse the range at most once.
   - Common use cases include searching (`std::find`), checking equality (`std::equal`), and counting elements (`std::count`).

2. **Equality / Inequality Comparison**:

   - Input iterators can be compared for equality and inequality.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (it1 == it2) { /* they point to the same element */ }
     if (it1 != it2) { /* they point to different elements */ }
     ```

3. **Dereferencing**:

   - Input iterators can be dereferenced using `*` to access the value and `->` to access members of the element.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int value = *it;  // Dereference to get the value
     auto member = it->member;  // Access member element
     ```

4. **Incrementable**:

   - Input iterators support both pre-increment (`++it`) and post-increment (`it++`) to move to the next element.
   - They cannot be decremented.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     ++it;  // Pre-increment
     it++;  // Post-increment
     ```

5. **Swappable**:
   - The values pointed to by input iterators can be swapped.

## Practical Implementation

Let's explore some practical implementations to understand how input iterators are used in STL algorithms.

1. **`std::find`**:

   - Searches for an element in a range and returns an iterator to the first occurrence of the element.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <algorithm> // for std::find

     int main() {
         std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
         auto it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3);

         if (it != vec.end()) {
             std::cout << "Element found: " << *it << std::endl;
         } else {
             std::cout << "Element not found" << std::endl;
         }

         return 0;
     }
     ```

2. **`std::copy`**:

   - Copies a range of elements from one container to another. Input iterators are used to read elements from the source container.
   - Example:

     ```cpp
     #include <iostream>
     #include <vector>
     #include <algorithm> // for std::copy
     #include <iterator>  // for std::ostream_iterator

     int main() {
         std::vector<int> source = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
         std::vector<int> destination(5);

         std::copy(source.begin(), source.end(), destination.begin());

         // Output the copied elements
         std::cout << "Destination vector: ";
         for (int val : destination) {
             std::cout << val << " ";
         }
         std::cout << std::endl;

         return 0;
     }
     ```

## Limitations

Input iterators have several limitations that make them the weakest type of iterator:

1. **Single-Pass Algorithms Only**:

   - Input iterators cannot be used in algorithms requiring multiple passes over the data. They are unidirectional and can only move forward.

2. **Read-Only Access**:

   - Input iterators cannot modify the elements they point to. They provide read-only access.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     *it = 7; // Not allowed with input iterators
     ```

3. **No Decrement**:

   - Input iterators do not support decrement operations.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     --it; // Not allowed with input iterators
     ```

4. **Limited Relational Operators**:

   - Input iterators can be compared for equality (`==`) and inequality (`!=`), but they do not support other relational operators like `<` or `>`.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (it1 == it2) { /* Allowed */ }
     if (it1 <= it2) { /* Not allowed */ }
     ```

5. **No Arithmetic Operations**:
   - Input iterators do not support arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     it + 1; // Not allowed with input iterators
     it - 1; // Not allowed with input iterators
     ```
