let's break down the process of representing the decimal number 0.1 in binary, then in IEEE 754 floating-point format (32 bit).

### 1. Binary Representation

To represent 0.1 in binary, we use the fractional binary representation. This involves repeatedly multiplying the fractional part by 2 and recording the integer part of the result at each step until we reach the desired precision or the fraction becomes 0.

For 0.1:

1. Multiply 0.1 by 2: (0.1 X 2 = 0.2). Record the integer part, which is 0.
2. Multiply the fractional part (0.2) by 2: (0.2 X 2 = 0.4). Record the integer part, which is 0.
3. Repeat this process until we get the desired precision or the fraction becomes 0.

This process yields a repeating binary fraction:
[0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011...]

### 2. IEEE 754 Floating-Point Representation

Now, let's represent this binary fraction in IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point format, which consists of three parts: sign bit, exponent, and mantissa.

#### Sign Bit

- Since 0.1 is a positive number, the sign bit is 0.

#### Exponent

- The exponent is used to represent the magnitude of the number and is biased.
- There are 8 bits in 32 bit Floating point representation.
- In IEEE 754 single-precision format, the bias is 2^7 - 1 = 127 (2^(L-1) -1 where l is number of exponent bits).
- To represent the exponent, we need to determine how many positions the binary point needs to be shifted to normalize the binary fraction.
- For 0.1, the binary fraction is (1.1001100110011001100110011001100110011... X 2^{-4}).
- So, the biased exponent is ( -4 + 127 = 123 ), which in binary is (01111011).

#### Mantissa

- The mantissa is the fraction part of the normalized binary number.
- In IEEE 754 single-precision format, it is normalized by appending 23 bits after the binary point.
- For 0.1, the fractional part after normalization is (10011001100110011001100).

### Final Representation

Putting it all together:
[0 01111011 10011001100110011001100]

### Formulas

- **Normalized Representation**: (1.xxxxxxx X 2^n), where (x) represents the fractional part of the binary number and (n) is the exponent.
- **Exponent Calculation**: (exponent = unbiased, exponent + bias), where the bias is 2^(L-1) -1 for single-precision.
- **Bias**: The bias is added to the unbiased exponent to get the stored exponent. For single-precision, the bias is 2^(L-1) -1
- **where L is number of exponent bits**.

This representation allows us to accurately store and manipulate fractional numbers in a binary system.
