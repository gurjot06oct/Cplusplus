Let's delve into the concept of comparing a signed `char` (`a`) and an unsigned `char` (`b`) in C++.

### Explanation

#### Signed `char` (`a`)

- In C++, `char` can be either signed or unsigned depending on the implementation. By default, its signedness varies across different platforms.
- When `char` is signed, it typically uses one bit for the sign and the rest for the value (7 bits for values up to 127). This means the range of a signed `char` is usually from -128 to 127.
- In the code snippet provided, `char a = 0xfb;` initializes `a` with the hexadecimal value `0xfb`, which in decimal is -5.

#### Unsigned `char` (`b`)

- `unsigned char` explicitly declares the `char` as unsigned, meaning it uses all 8 bits for non-negative values (0 to 255).
- `unsigned char b = 0xfb;` initializes `b` with the same hexadecimal value `0xfb`, which in decimal is 251.

#### Comparison Behavior

- When comparing `a` (signed `char`) and `b` (unsigned `char`), the comparison considers their types and their actual values.
- In the code `if (a == b)`, despite both `a` and `b` having the same hexadecimal value `0xfb`, they are not considered equal.
- This is because the signedness and the range of values that `a` and `b` can represent differ. Specifically:
  - `a` as a signed `char` interprets `0xfb` as -5.
  - `b` as an unsigned `char` interprets `0xfb` as 251.
- Even though the bit pattern in memory for both `a` and `b` might be the same (`0xfb`), their effective values differ due to their signedness interpretation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char a = 0xfb;           // Signed char 'a' initialized with hexadecimal value 0xfb (-5 in decimal)
    unsigned char b = 0xfb;  // Unsigned char 'b' initialized with hexadecimal value 0xfb (251 in decimal)

    std::cout << "a = " << static_cast<int>(a);  // Output the decimal value of 'a'
    std::cout << "\nb = " << static_cast<int>(b);  // Output the decimal value of 'b'

    if (a == b)
        std::cout << "\nSame";
    else
        std::cout << "\nNot Same";

    // Output: Not Same
    // int(a) = -5, int(b) = 251

    return 0;
}
```

#### Conclusion

- The output of the program demonstrates `Not Same` because, in C++, signed and unsigned types are treated differently in comparison operations.
- Understanding the signedness of variables (`char`, `int`, etc.) is crucial to interpreting their values correctly, especially when performing comparisons or operations that rely on type-specific behavior.
