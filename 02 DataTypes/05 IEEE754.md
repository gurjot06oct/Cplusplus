## IEEE 754 Floating-Point Representation Using Example

Let's break down the process of representing the decimal number 0.1 in binary and then in IEEE 754 floating-point format (32-bit).

### 1. Binary Representation

To represent 0.1 in binary, we repeatedly multiply the fractional part by 2 and record the integer part of the result at each step until we reach the desired precision.

For 0.1:

1. Multiply 0.1 by 2: $0.1 \times 2 = 0.2$. Record the integer part: 0.
2. Multiply 0.2 by 2: $0.2 \times 2 = 0.4$. Record the integer part: 0.
3. Continue this process: $0.4 \times 2 = 0.8$ (integer part: 0), $0.8 \times 2 = 1.6$ (integer part: 1), etc.

This yields a repeating binary fraction: $0.00011001100110011\ldots$

### 2. IEEE 754 Floating-Point Representation

IEEE 754 single-precision format consists of three parts: sign bit, exponent, and mantissa.

#### Sign Bit

- Since 0.1 is positive, the sign bit is 0.

#### Exponent

- There are 8 bits for the exponent in 32-bit floating-point representation.
- The bias for the exponent is $2^7 - 1 = 127$.
- Normalize the binary fraction: $0.1_{10} = 1.1001100110011\ldots \times 2^{-4}$.
- Calculate the biased exponent: $-4 + 127 = 123$.
- Convert 123 to binary: $01111011$.

#### Mantissa

- The mantissa is the fractional part of the normalized binary number.
- In 32-bit format, it includes 23 bits after the binary point.
- For 0.1, the mantissa is $10011001100110011001100$.

### Final Representation

Combining all parts:
- **Sign bit**: 0
- **Exponent**: 01111011
- **Mantissa**: 10011001100110011001100

Final IEEE 754 representation: `0 01111011 10011001100110011001100`

### Formulas

- **Normalized Representation**: $1.xxxxxxx \times 2^n$
- **Exponent Calculation**: exponent = unbiased exponent + bias
- **Bias**: $2^{(L-1)} - 1$ (for single-precision, $L = 8$, so bias = 127)

This representation allows accurate storage and manipulation of fractional numbers in a binary system.
