## Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++ Using `new` and `delete`

In C++, the `new` and `delete` operators are fundamental for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. They offer a more flexible and type-safe approach compared to traditional C-style functions. This article will explore their usage, covering allocation and deallocation for both single objects and arrays of objects.

### Single Object Allocation and Deallocation

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Constructor called!" << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyClass()
    {
        std::cout << "Destructor called!" << std::endl;
    }
    void display() const
    {
        std::cout << "Hello from MyClass!" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    // Dynamically allocate memory for a single object
    MyClass *ptr = new MyClass;

    // Deallocate memory
    delete ptr;

    return 0;
}
```

When dynamically allocating memory for a single object using `new`, the constructor of the class is called to initialize the object. Similarly, when deallocating memory using `delete`, the destructor is invoked to perform any necessary cleanup.

### Array Allocation and Deallocation

```cpp
// Dynamically allocate memory for an array of objects
MyClass *arr = new MyClass[5];

// Deallocate memory
delete[] arr;
```

Similarly, when dynamically allocating memory for an array of objects using `new[]`, the constructors of the individual objects are called. Upon deallocation using `delete[]`, the destructors are invoked for each object in the array.

### Memory Management Best Practices

1. **Single Object vs. Array Allocation**:

   - Use `delete` for single objects allocated with `new`.
   - Use `delete[]` for arrays of objects allocated with `new[]`.

2. **Type Safety**:
   - Unlike C-style functions, `new` and `delete` operators do not require explicit type casting.

Understanding and mastering these concepts ensures efficient memory management in C++ programs, contributing to their flexibility and reliability.
