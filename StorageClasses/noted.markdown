In C++, storage classes are a way to define the scope, visibility, and lifetime of variables and/or functions within a C++ program. They help the compiler understand how to manage memory and optimize access to these variables. The major storage classes in C++ are:

1. **Automatic Storage Class (`auto`)**
2. **Register Storage Class (`register`)**
3. **Static Storage Class (`static`)**
4. **External Storage Class (`extern`)**
5. **Mutable Storage Class (`mutable`)**
6. **Thread Storage Class (`thread_local`)**

### Summary

- **auto:** Default local variable storage, primarily for type inference in modern C++.
- **register:** Suggests storing the variable in a register for faster access.
- **static:** Persistent across function calls; file-scoped if used at file level.
- **extern:** Indicates that the variable is defined in another file.
- **mutable:** Allows modification of a member even in const objects.
- **thread_local:** Ensures each thread has its own instance of the variable.
